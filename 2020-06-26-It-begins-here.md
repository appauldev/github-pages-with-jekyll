Imagine this.

You woke up and did your usual morning routine. You fixed your bed, cooked and ate breakfast, took a shower, and dressed up for work. However, upon stepping outside your door, it has been clear to you that this was never your ordinary day: everything outside is in ruins, as if a war took place during your sleep. But something feels off about what is happening. Your were not intrigued about how all of this could have happened without waking you up or why was your house the only standing building in your vicinity. What baffles you the most during the moment is the sight of your neighbor's ruined house. The structure was not destroyed by means that would send debris flying everywhere. In fact, you could not find any debris around the place. You investigated further by taking a closer look at the obliterated house, and as you walk towards the ruins, you know your hunch was right. You can feel the warmth as you step closer. You can see the drips on what remains of the walls. You called your director but after several failed calls, you just left a voice message: _"He has escaped, I repeat, Superman has escaped. He melted everything here, thank God I'm alive. Please call me ASAP."_
